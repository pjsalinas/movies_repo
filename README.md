## Introduction
This project analyzed the movie industry on behalf of Microsoft Inc., which is considering investing in the movie business. Due to the numerous factors that influence the success of a movie across various platforms, and considering Microsoft's time constraints and pressure, we focused on analyzing a limited number of key parameters to gain insights and generate actionable recommendations for the Microsoft board of directors.

## Overview
Microsoft is exploring the possibility of entering the movie industry using its surplus cash. In 2019, the movie business was valued at $42.2 billion, while the global film industry, including box office and home entertainment revenue, was worth $136 billion in 2018. To assess the viability of such an investment, Microsoft is planning to conduct a thorough analysis of the movie business, focusing on aspects such as profitability and budget. Once the Microsoft board approves the investment, the company will move forward with hiring directors, writers, and actors.

### Conda Environment

## Data
The Microsoft Marketing team provided us with several datasets pertaining to the movie industry. After careful consideration, we selected the two most relevant and reliable datasets. Using these datasets, we were able to evaluate and analyze various types of data such as dates, profits, budgets, and other relevant factors.

## Results
After several considerations, Microsoft's panel concluded that for now, they would like to find answers to the following questions:
- What are the most profitable movies, and how much to spend on them?
- What are the most common genre?
- What is the best time of the year to release a movie?
